#1.
```
input: const data=[{ id: 1, name: "eg", roll:4}, {id:2, name:"eg2",roll:5}, {id: 3, name:"eg3", roll: 9},...];
output: total = [4, 9, 18...]
```

#2. use input array and find the index of the elements, find even index positions and make sum of them, find odd index position and make sum of them, find total of both the sums and see weather it's even or odd?
#[code](https://github.com/purnima999/React_solutions/blob/main/two.js).
```
input:  ['j', 'd', 'k', 'e', 'n', 'v', 'g', 'h'];
output: sum of even value is even 12, sum of add values is odd 14, total of both sum is even 26. 
```

#3. find the number from string and reverse only the number.
